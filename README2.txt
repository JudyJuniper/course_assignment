Course assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data
run_analysis.R has comments to help explain coding

Working directory must be "UCI HAR Dataset" as unzipped from the course instructions link
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
Program does the following
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

You will also need to download the newHeaders.csv file for re-naming the descriptive variable names (step 4) 
(i am sorry for the extra step... please review as you can. my course closes in two days, by 5/22/20...)

Thank you!
