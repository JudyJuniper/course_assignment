From the raw data, activity codes line up with the following labels:
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

From the raw data, the following columns were extracted to comply with step 2 of the instructions (see README2.txt)
for extracting std and mean values:
1 tBodyAcc-mean()-X

testData
	the combined columns of subjectTest (also known as Test ID), yTest (also known as Activity Test ID), xTest
trainData
	the combined columsn of subjectTrain (also known as Train ID), yTrain (also known as Activity Train ID), xTrain

mergedData
	the merged data of testData and trainData, merged by Test ID and Train ID. 

actList
	the combined activity list from Activity Test ID and Activity Train ID. 
	actList is then mutated onto mergedData
	
filteredData
	the filtered data of mergedData. See which variables were extracted above. Test ID (subject ID), actList were also filtered for
	filteredData$actList is renamed from numeric values 1 through 6 to the corresponding activity name (Walking, etc). See key above. 
	newHeaders.csv is used to rename the headers according to what variables were extracted in the previous steps

Note: the below code is applied to each activity description: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying
walkingAvgFinalFinal
	data frame with every subject's Walking activity values averaged
	intermediary variables used include
		walkRows: all walking records from filteredData
		walkingVal: all walking records per a specific subjectID (looped with "while j")
		walkingAvgTemp: averaging all the numeric values of each specific subjectID's walking records. fill with zeroes if not applicable, no data
		walkingAvgFinal: the final averaged walking values for a specific subjectID that is then added on to the walkgAvgFinalFinal
		
final
	dataframe with all combined walkingAvgFinalFinal, walkingUpAvgFinalFinal, etc. 
	create final$test_or_train depending if subjectID was found in the test or train group
